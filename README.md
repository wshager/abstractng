✨ **Knowlegde sharing tools** ✨

## Purpose

- Why is the current JS landscape the way it is?
- What kind of patterns and abstractions are underlying functional frameworks like RxJS and Transducers?
- How do these patterns and abstractions relate to each other?
- Can we reduce the number of frameworks in our stack and if (not) so, why?
